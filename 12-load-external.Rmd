# US State EV Stock via NREL

2021 Vehicle registration counts derived by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory with data from Experian Information Solutions																
																
Notes: 																
Only all-electric vehicles (EVs)  are included in this chart; plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are not included.																
Registration counts are approximate.																
																
Worksheet available at afdc.energy.gov/data

```{r load ev_stock}

ev_stock_load <- read_excel("raw_data/EV_Stock_Reg_State.xlsx", skip=2)
ev_stock_load

#total US EVs is 1019260, therefore Arizona has 0.02822636 of US EV's at 28770 units

ev_state_stock = ev_stock_load %>% select(1:2) %>% filter(State!="Total") %>% rename(ev_stock ="Registration Count")

#sum(ev_state_stock$`Registration Count`) - 1019260
#total ev stock does not include territories, since sum(50 state row) = US total row. Therefore, can eliminate US row

ev_state_stock

#note, NREL US EV 2020 total of 1019260 closely alligns with RMI reported EV 2020 total of 1107426. RMI total may be higher because it is total vehicle stock, while NREL is registrations only

# US State Vehicle Counts

2010-2020 total vehicle *registration* counts by state as reported by Bureau of Transportation Statistics. This dataset also includes highway VMT, highway use of gasoline, persons traveling, person trips, and other metrics.						
																
Notes: 																
Children aged 0-4 are not counted as persons traveling.
Puerto Rico is included in US totals but is not shown as an individual state.

# US State VMT

2020ANNUAL VEHICLE - MILES by State from the Highway Statistics Series by DOT. 	
																
Notes: 																
Travel for the rural minor collector and rural/urban local functional systems is estimated by the States based on a model or other means and provided to the FHWA on a summary basis. Travel for all other systems are estimated from State-provided data in the Highway Performance Monitoring System.
Puerto Rico is both included in US totals and is shown as an individual state.
